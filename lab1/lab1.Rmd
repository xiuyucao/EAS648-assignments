## Fig1 --> Wildfire events in the whole United states **using tmap??**
(read in data and plot first here and hide the codes, hereafter only show the codes but do no evaluation)

## Code and comments
Beginning here, I put all my codes and explanations, with figures to help explicitly explan

The packages needed are as follows. First load all the packages **remember to comment the packages**
```{r eval=F}
library(sf)
library(plotly)  # seems i didnt use this package
library(tigris)
library(dplyr)
library(mapsf)
library(usmap)
```
## read the data
```{r eval=F}
wildfire_all = read.csv('../data/lab1/wildfire.csv')  # all of the wildland fires in previous years in the US
resp18_all = read.csv('../data/lab1/2018_RESP.csv')  # all of the respiratory death in the US in 2018
```
## glimpse of the data
The meanings of the attributes are as follows **(create a table)**
