Wildfire occurs frequently around the United States. According to the data from [National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com), just in last year (2022), there have been 40,000 of wildfire events across the country, as is shown in the following map.
```{r read data and plot us wildfires, echo=F,eval=T}
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
wildfire_all = read.csv('../data/lab1/wildfire.csv')  # all of the wildland fires in previous years in the US
resp18_all = read.csv('../data/lab1/2018_RESP.csv')  # all of the respiratory death in the US in 2018
wildfire_us = subset(wildfire_all, substring(FireDiscoveryDateTime,3,4)=='22')
wildfire_us=st_as_sf(wildfire_us,coords=c('X','Y'),crs=4326)
usa <- st_as_sf(maps::map("state", fill=TRUE, plot =FALSE))
usa=st_transform(usa,crs=4308)
ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data=usa)+
  geom_sf(data=wildfire_us,size=.02,col='red')+
  ggtitle('This is a Title')+
  labs(title = "Wildfire Events in the United States, 2022")+
  xlim(-130,-60)+ylim(25,50)
```

Each red point in the map represents a single wildfire event in 2022. As we can see, the west coast of the United States experience a higher frequency of wildfires. This is due to multiple reasons including the climate, vegetation kind, topography, etc. Apart from the extensive damage wildfires inflict on the ecosystem, the particles and gases they emit also raise concerns about public health.

In order to find out the impact of wildfires on public health, I analyzed the correlation between wildfire frequency and deaths caused by resiratory diseases in California. The method and result are as follows

******************************************************
## Method and Result
The wildfire data is from [NIFC](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com). It contains all the wildfire events in the past 20 years in the United States.
```{r eval=F}
wildfire_all = read.csv('../data/lab1/wildfire.csv')  # read the downloaded wildfire data
```
The key attributes of the data are as follows.

| Attribute Name        | Meaning                          | Class     | Example                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| X                     | Longitude                        | numeric   | -118.18071             |
| Y                     | Latitude                         | numeric   | 22.80898               |
| FireDiscoveryDateTime | Time When the Fire is Discovered | character | 2020/02/28 20:45:40+00 |

The respiratory death rate data is from [the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](https://www.healthdata.org). From its data gateway, we can get the data of a specific year. In this study, to get rid of the impact of Covid 19, I used the data of 2018.
```{r eval=F}
resp18_all = read.csv('../data/lab1/2018_RESP.csv')  # read the downloaded respiratory death rate data
```
The key attributes of the data are as follows

| Attribute    | Meaning                                | Class   | Example      |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|---------|--------------|
| fips         | FIP code of the place (state + county) | integer | 6115         |
| race_id      | race group (1 for all races)           | integer | 1            |
| age_group_id | age group (22 for all ages)            | integer | 22           |
| val          | respiratory death rate                 | numeric | 4.899945e-06 |

The California counties boundary data can be downloaded using function `tigris::counties()`. Set the coordinate reference system to 4326 for future intersection with wildfire event points.
```{r get counties data, message=F, results='hide', eval=T}
counties_CA = counties(state='CA')
counties_CA = st_transform(counties_CA, crs=4326)
```
The key attributes of the data are as follows.

| Attribute    | Meaning                                | Class   | Example      |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|---------|--------------|
|STATEFP       |FIP code of the state                   |character|06|
|COUNTYFG      |FIP code of the county                  |character|091|

Then, we need to integrate these data into a counties polygon data with wildfire and death rate data. For wildfire data, we firstly need to convert it into simple feature and then we can do intersection with counties data to get wildfire event counts in each polygon. Here I chosed wildfire events during 2016-2018 instead of just 2018 because I don't think impacts of wildfire on public health is short-term. Therefore I chosed 3 years of data.
```{r add wildfire count, message=F, results='hide', eval=T}
# get wildfire in the California bounding box and during year 2016-2018
wildfire_selected = subset(wildfire_all, Y>32.5 & Y<42.1 & X>(-124.5) & X<(-114.1) & substring(FireDiscoveryDateTime,3,4) %in% c('16','17','18'))
wildfire_selected= st_as_sf(wildfire_selected, coords=c('X','Y'),crs=4326)  # get sf wildfire points
counties_CA$wildfire_count=lengths(st_intersects(counties_CA,wildfire_selected))  # count wildfire events on each polygon
```


For respiratory death data, we can firstly choose data from California and then join it to the counties data by FIP code. Noting previous attribute tables that the FIP codes in counties data are different in format from those in death rate data. So we need to do some processing.
```{r join death rate data, message=F, results='hide',eval=T}
# trim the data, choose data from CA and get only useful attributes
resp18_CA = subset(resp18_all, substring(fips,1,1)=='6' & race_name=='Total' & age_group_id==22)
# get FIP same in format to those of the death rate data
counties_CA$FIP = as.integer(paste0(substring(counties_CA$STATEFP,2),counties_CA$COUNTYFP))
# do the join
counties_result = left_join(counties_CA,resp18_CA,by=c('FIP'='fips'))
# make the number of death rate not too small
counties_result$vale4 = counties_result$val*10e4
```
Now we have the data we want. We plot!
```{r plot result, eval=T}
cal2plot=st_transform(counties_result,crs=3309)  # set projection to 3309 to get the correct scale
mf_theme('default',pos='center')  # set the position of the title
mf_map(x=cal2plot,type='choro',var='vale4',
       breaks='jenks',nbreaks=5,
       leg_title='Respiratory Death Rate\n(10e-4)', leg_title_cex=.7, leg_val_cex=.6, leg_val_rnd=0, leg_pos='topright')
mf_map(x=cal2plot,type='prop',var='wildfire_count',
       inches=0.22,
       leg_title='Wildfire Count', leg_title_cex=.7, leg_val_cex=.6, leg_pos='right')
mf_layout(title='Wildfires and Respiratory Deaths in California', 
          credits=paste0('Sources: NIFC and IHME \nCartographer: Xiuyu Cao\nDate: Oct 11, 2023\n','mapsf ',packageVersion('mapsf')),
          frame=F)
```

As is shown in the map, generally, there is a correlation between wildfire occurrences and respiratory deaths. The more frequent wildfire happens, the more death by respiratory diseases will occur. Therefore, urgent action is required, whether in the form of wildfire mitigation efforts on the West Coast or an enhancement of public healthcare measures, to effectively combat respiratory diseases and deaths. 

******************************************************
## Discussion
Although there is a positive correlation between wildfire frequency and respiratory death rate in most counties of California, there is an abnormal high frequency of wildfire and low respiratory deaths in Los Angeles. As is shown in the following chart, the wildfire counts in LA is far more than in other places.
```{r plot wildfire count bar chart in CA, eval=T}
# plot wildfire frequency bar chart in CA
counties_result %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=NAME,y=wildfire_count))+  # set X and Y values
  geom_bar(stat='identity',fill='red')+  # set stat to show original count and fill color
  labs(title='Wildfire Frequencies in Didfferent Counties in CA, 2016-2018',  # set title
       x='County',y='Wildfire Frequency')+  # set X Y axes labels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))  # set the rotation of X text to 90 degrees
```

The combination of abnormal high frequency of wildfire and low respiratory deaths in Los Angeles may be caused by the following reasons.

* problematic wildfire severity assessment method
* different health care level among counties
* different fire response time among counties
* different fire event counting ability among counties
* ...

For example, our method of assessing wildfire severity is using counts. However, other aspects should also be taken into account. For example, duration, size, etc. As we can see from the wildfire perimeter data from [NIFC](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com), the sizes of wildfires in LA are much smaller than those in other regions.

Also, maybe Los Angeles is just more advanced in wildfire detection and recoding so that it has more wild fire counts thant outher places.

For future study, we can improve our result by using a more rigorous and scientific variable that can assess the severity of wildfires in a region. The possibilities are as follows.

* Give different weights to different wildfire indexes (counts, size, duration, ...)
* Use instrument variables (e.g. biomass loss) as proxies for wildfire severity
* ...
